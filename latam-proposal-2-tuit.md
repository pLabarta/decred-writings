The second Decred Latam Marketing and Events proposal is live on Politeia. The first one allowed us to gather the Spanish team, now we are going full digital.

https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b677462d6d22d61bf786798e975b38df7a203c2467429d4ec91f75ef0c40

If you want to know about our plans for Decred in Latam, keep reading!



2/

What?

We propose to keep a dedicated budget for creating Spanish content, working on PR and expanding the Latam community. Covid-19 was a critical element to consider and pushed us to turn into a completely digital approach.



3/

Why?

The crypto space is growing quickly in Latam. 5 out of the 10 top countries owning crypto are here. It represents a quarter of all transactions on LocalBitcoins. Crypto is proving to be an answer to problems like hyperinflation and the lack of access to financial services.



4/

How?

We came up with different media products that will be at the core of our upcoming work. Expanding the team allowed us to develop our own content creation workflow. We are also focusing on reaching out to dev communities and onboard new people to the Decred dev team.

Who are we?

The Latam Marketing team is based in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico:
